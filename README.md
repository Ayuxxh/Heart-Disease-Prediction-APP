# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease in a patient based on clinical parameters using machine learning models. The app is built with Python and deployed via Streamlit to provide an interactive web-based interface.

## 🚀 Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training using:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - (Additional models optional)
- Streamlit-based user interface for live prediction
- Easy-to-use input form for user data
- Real-time classification output

---

## 📦 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Streamlit
